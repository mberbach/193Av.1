    <h3>A Beginning and an End</h3>
    <p>'When the young <strong>Alan Turing (June 23, 1912-June 7, 1954) lost the love of his life, Christopher</strong>, to a bacterium contracted from cow's milk,
         the grief-savaged future father of computing comforted his beloved's grief-savaged mother by telling her that “the body provides something for the spirit to look after and use.”
         <strong>For the remainder of his life, he never ceased contemplating this binary code of body and spirit</strong> — 
         a preoccupation fanned by this leveling loss in young adulthood, but <strong>ignited in childhood, by a book</strong> he had been given at age ten,
          a book he later told his own mother <strong>was what opened his mind and heart to science.</strong> Published the year Turing was born,
           impishly described by its author as being “mostly about things that you do not learn in school,”
           <strong>Natural Wonders Every Child Should Know by Edwin Tinney Brewster</strong> invited young minds to step through the portal of science
             and contemplate not why life is — the domain of Sunday school theology — but what life is and how it came to be that way.

             <h2> Before Scientists, There Were Natural Philosophers; On the Author</h2>
             <p>'Before there were scientists, it fell on the “natural philosophers” — 
              men (for they were only men) typically trained in theology — to make sense of
               nature's phenomena and processes. Brewster was born in the middle of the nineteenth century,
                only a generation after the person for whom the word scientist was coined — the polymathic Scottish 
                mathematician Mary Somerville — and he devoted his life to aiding humanity's great migration from the epoch
                 of religion to the epoch of reality.' - same source as above </p>
