  <main>        <h2>My Interest in Turing</h2>
    <h3>Importance to CS</h3>
    <p>
      Alan Turing is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in computer science. 
      His groundbreaking work laid the theoretical foundation for modern computing, particularly through his conceptualization of the Turing machine,
       an abstracted device that in part formalized the notion of algorithmic computation. Turing's contributions were pivotal in advancing the understanding
        of computation and played a crucial role in the development of digital computers. Truly someone ahead of his time.

    <h3>Importance of Our Past</h3>

    <p>
      Studying influential figures of the past provides invaluable insights into the trajectory of human progress and the evolution of ideas.
       By examining their lives, accomplishments, and challenges, we gain a deeper understanding of the historical context in which they lived
        and the societal forces that shape our lives. Learning about their journeys can offer valuable lessons in perseverance,
       innovation, and resilience.
    </p>


    <h3>and Finally... Why Turing</h3>

    <p>
      While Turing is celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to computer science, his journey was fraught with challenges and setbacks.
      The world he lived in rejected him in a number of ways, so his success could be said to be despite the adversities of life. In that way I can
      find his story relatable. To distill the meaning I find in his story; It is to not let the hand dealt to you, define your potential.
